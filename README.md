This Tracker is designed for use by senior citizens to keep track of the various medical appointments they may have.
Care was taken to ensure that the colors used are in high constrast, the font size and buttons are large enough for senior citizens to read, and a special font designed to ensure accessibility was used throughout the application. I ran the website through the following accessibility checkers to ensure that screen readers and users with low vision will be able to use it.
